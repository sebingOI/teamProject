# strat &middot; [![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/strat.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strat) [![License](https://img.shields.io/npm/l/strat.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/strat) [![Travis CI](https://img.shields.io/travis/citycide/strat.svg?style=flat-square)](https://travis-ci.org/citycide/strat) [![JavaScript Standard Style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://standardjs.com)

_strat_ is a modern, dependency-free JavaScript library for formatting strings.
It takes inspiration from Python's [`str.format()`][pythonref] but is focused
more on being at home in ES2015+ JavaScript than strictly adhering to Python's
conventions.

If you want stricter Python conventions, check out [string-format][string-format],
on which this project was based.

> **try it live** on [**runkit**](https://npm.runkit.com/strat)

## features

* formatting can be partially applied, allowing for reusable template functions
* reference object properties as replacement values
* object methods are called and can be passed arguments
* TypeScript friendly by shipping with definitions

## installation

### node

1. Install

   Using [Yarn][yarn]:

   ```console
   yarn
   ```

   Or using npm:

   ```console
   npm i strat
   ```

2. Import

   ```js
   import strat from 'strat'

   // commonjs / ES5
   const strat = require('strat')
   ```

### typescript

Usage in TypeScript is the same as ES2015+ with the addition of all exported types:

```ts
import strat, { Transformer, FormatPartial /*...*/ } from 'strat'
```

### browser

Just drop this repo's `index.js` in as a script tag to expose the `strat` function:

```html
<script src="path/to/strat/index.js"></script>
<script>
strat('{} {}!', ['Hello', 'world'])
</script>
```

If you prefer a CDN, you can use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/strat"></script>
<!-- or, with a version: -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/strat@1.2.0"></script>
```

_NOTE: strat requires an environment supporting ES2015 syntax like `let` and
arrow functions. For Node, this is Node v4.0 or greater. See [node.green](node.green)
for Node compatibility, or [compat-table](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/)
for other environments._

## usage

### view from the top

```js
strat('{name}, {ultimate}, {catchphrase}', hero)
// -> 'Reinhardt, Earthshatter, "Hammer DOWN!"'
```

Compare that to the equivalent string concatenation in ES5:

```js
hero.name + ', ' + hero.ultimate + ', "' + hero.catchphrase + '"'
```

Or the more modern template literals from ES2015:

```js
`${hero.name}, ${hero.ultimate}, "${hero.catchphrase}"`
```

But the _strat_ function can also be partially applied to create
reusable template functions. Just leave out the replacements like so:

```js
const template = strat('{name}, {ultimate}, {catchphrase}')

template(reinhardt)
// -> 'Reinhardt, Earthshatter, "Honor! Glory! REINHARDT!"'
template(tracer)
// -> 'Tracer, Pulse Bomb, "Cheers, love! The cavalry's here!"'
template(mccree)
// -> 'McCree, Deadeye, "Ain't I killed you somewhere before?"'
```

### modes

_strat_ can actually be used in two modes:
- [function mode](#function-mode) _(recommended)_
- [method mode](#method-mode)

#### function mode

```js
strat('You got- you gotta run {}.', 'Morty')
// -> 'You got- you gotta run Morty.'

strat(`When you come to a {} in the road, {}.`, ['fork', 'take it'])
// -> 'When you come to a fork in the road, take it.'
```

This is the recommended and standard way to use _strat_. Here, the first
argument is your template string. The second argument is an array of replacement
values, or just a single value.

The second argument can optionally be left out, in which case a new function
will be returned that you can call with your replacement parameters.

```js
const template = strat('Like {} and {}')
template(['salt', 'pepper'])
// -> 'Like salt and pepper'
template(['peanut butter', 'jelly'])
// -> 'Like peanut butter and jelly'
```

#### method mode

```js
'Yall got anymore of them... {}?'.format('prototypes')
// -> 'Yall got anymore of them... prototypes?'

`Gets hard out here for a {}, {}`.format(['prototype', 'son'])
// -> 'Gets hard out here for a prototype, son.'
```

This mode is _not_ enabled by default and is _not_ recommended - extending built in
prototypes with non-standard methods is generally [considered a bad practice][protoextend]
and it even [hinders the progress of the language][smooshgate]. If you want to use
it as shown above, you must first use [`strat.extend`](#stratextendobject-object-transformers--functions-):

```js
strat.extend(String.prototype)
```

`strat(template, [...values])` and `template.format([...values])` can then
be used interchangeably.

> **Important Note**

> You should probably **not** use this unless you are developing an application.
> If you are developing a library this will affect end users who have no control
> over your extension of the built-in `String.prototype`.

### api

#### `strat(template: string, replacements: any | [...values]): string`

Returns the result of replacing each `{â€¦}` placeholder in the template
string with its corresponding replacement.

Placeholders may contain numbers which refer to positional arguments:

```js
strat('{0}, you have {1} unread message{2}', ['Holly', 2, 's'])
// -> 'Holly, you have 2 unread messages'
```

Unmatched placeholders produce no output:

```js
strat('{0}, you have {1} unread message{2}', ['Steve', 1])
// -> 'Steve, you have 1 unread message'
```

A format string may reference a positional argument multiple times:

```js
strat(`The name's {1}. {0} {1}.`, ['James', 'Bond'])
// -> "The name's Bond. James Bond."
```

Positional arguments may be referenced implicitly:

```js
strat('{}, you have {} unread message{}', ['Steve', 1])
// -> 'Steve, you have 1 unread message'
```

A format string must not contain both implicit and explicit references:

```js
strat('My name is {} {}. Do you like the name {0}?', ['Lemony', 'Snicket'])
// -> Error: cannot mix implicit & explicit formatting
```

Escape `{` and `}` characters by doubling it ( ie. `{{` and `}}` produce
`{` and `}` respectively ):

```js
strat('{{}} creates an empty {} {}', ['object', 'literal'])
// -> '{} creates an empty object literal'
```

Dot notation may be used to reference object properties:

```js
const rick = { firstName: 'Rick', lastName: 'Sanchez' }
const morty = { firstName: 'Morty', lastName: 'Smith' }

strat('{0.firstName} {0.lastName} and {1.firstName} {1.lastName}', [rick, morty])
// -> 'Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith'
```

`0.` may be omitted when referencing a property of `{0}`:

```js
const song = {
  title: 'Handlebars',
  artist: 'Flobots',
  album: 'Fight With Tools'
}

strat('{title} | [{artist}] | {album}', song)
// -> 'Handlebars | [Flobots] | Fight With Tools'
```

If the referenced property is a method, it is invoked with no arguments to
determine the replacement:

```js
const reacher = {
  firstName:   'Jack',
  lastName:    'Reacher',
  dob:         new Date('1960-10-29'),
  fullName:    function () { return strat('{firstName} {lastName}', this) },
  movieSequel: function () { return strat('{fullName}: never go back', this) }
}

strat('{fullName} was born {dob.toISOString}.', reacher)
// -> 'Jack Reacher was born 1960-10-29T00:00:00.000Z.'
// ... you probably shouldn't know that by the way

strat('Definitely watch {movieSequel.toUpperCase}', reacher)
// -> 'Definitely watch JACK REACHER: NEVER GO BACK'
```

To pass arguments to a method, pass them as a comma delimited list, with
a space after the method name:

```js
const person = {
  react (tired, mood) {
    if (tired) {
      if (mood === 'sad') return 'cried'
      return 'rolled his eyes'
    } else {
      if (mood === 'mad') return 'broke stuff'
      return 'shook his fist'
    }
  }
}

strat('Average Joe {react true, indifferent}.', person)
// -> 'Average Joe rolled his eyes.'
```

Note that all arguments are passed as strings, so you'll have to parse them
appropriately if you need, for example, a number or boolean.

However, you can use `_` to pass the falsy `null` value in the argument list:

```js
strat('Average Joe {react _, mad}.', person)
// -> 'Average Joe broke stuff.'
```

#### `strat.create(transformers?: { ...functions })`

You can create a new instance of _strat_ by calling `strat.create()`. You may
also optionally supply an object containing transformer functions that you can
use in `strat()` to modify string replacements.

Transformers are very similar to a function you'd pass to [`Array#map()`][mdn-array-map].
They receive three arguments: the value on which it's being used, the key, and the full
collection of replacements provided to the template.

```js
transform(value: string, key: string, collection: [...values]): string
```

To use a transformer, call it by prefixing it with `!` after the field name in
the template string. For example, `{reaction!exclaim}` where `exclaim` was
previously passed in the `transformers` object.

Here's a simple example operating only on the `value` argument:

```js
const instance = strat.create({
  exclaim: str => str.toUpperCase() + '!'
})

instance('Hello, {!exclaim}', 'world')
// -> 'Hello, WORLD!'
```

And here's one that uses all three arguments to semi-intelligently pluralize units:

```js
const instance = strat.create({
  pluralize (str, key, col) {
    const unit = key.slice(0, -5)
    const singular = unit.slice(0, -1)
    return col[0][unit] === 1 ? singular : unit
  }
})

const template = instance('{days}{daysLabel!pluralize}')

template({ days: 1, daysLabel: 'days' }) // -> '1day'
template({ days: 2, daysLabel: 'days' }) // -> '2days'
```

See [`strat.extend`](#stratextendobject-object-transformers--functions-) for a
more involved example.

#### `strat.extend(prototype: object, transformers?: { ...functions })`

> **Important Note**

> For most use cases it is recommended to use [function mode](#function-mode)
> instead, since extending built in prototypes is usually a bad idea.

This function can be used to extend any object (usually `String.prototype`) with
a `format` method. The second argument is optional, and is an object containing
transformer functions.

```js
strat.extend(String.prototype, {
  escape (str) {
    return str.replace(/[&<>"'`]/g, v => {
      return '&#' + v.charCodeAt(0) + ';'
    })
  }
})

const store = {
  name: 'Barnes & Noble',
  url: 'https://www.barnesandnoble.com/'
}

'<a href="{url!escape}">{name!escape}</a>'.format(store)
// -> '<a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/">Barnes &#38; Noble</a>'
```
